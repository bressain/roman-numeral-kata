roman-numeral-kata
==================

This is the standard roman numeral kata (both conversions) as well as the roman numeral calculator kata.

The roman numeral kata can be found [here](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanCalculator).

I was able to figure out the standard numeral kata conversions but I'll admit, I wasn't able to figure out the calculator algorithms on my own and found a nice version [here](http://turner.faculty.swau.edu/mathematics/materialslibrary/roman/).
